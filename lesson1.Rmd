## Principles

- Definitions of AI
  - Is thermostat AI?
  - Is chess playing AI?
  - Is machine translation AI?
  - "AI is what computers cannot do."
- Machine learning and AI
- Types of learning: Supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement 
  - Semi-supervised
- Supervised learning: Function approximation

## A look into History

- Overall, the Wiki for [history of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence) is a pretty good starting point
- Search and symbols (Cca 1950 - 1974)
  - 1965: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do." H. A. Simon
  - In parallel: first neuronal “networks”
    - [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)
  - AI Winter
- Expert systems Cca 1980 - 1987
  - IF-THEN rules
  - In parallel: revival of neural networks
    - Hebb rule, [Hopfield network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network)
    - Backpropagation
      - Biologically questionable, but see e.g. [Song et al. 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7610561/)
    - 3 layers are enough?!
  - Second AI Winter
